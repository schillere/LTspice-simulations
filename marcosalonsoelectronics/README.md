Files of video LTspice #19: BLDC Motor: Speed Regulation

Available at: https://youtu.be/i4hok5Mow5U

This video continues the study of the brushless DC (BLDC) motor by presenting how to design a PI compensator to regulate the speed of the BLDC motor. LTspice simulations are shown to demonstrate the operation of the motor in closed loop.
